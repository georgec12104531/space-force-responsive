# Kettle Web Development Challenge

ðŸ˜„Thanks for having a look at our Web Development Challenge.

## Goal

Create a responsive web page from design comps and written requirements.

## Expectations

We designed the challenge to be fun and help us discover how you like to work. It's not intended to measure how fast you are, so please provide realistic estimates, ask question as needed, and once you are ready for a review, open a pull request.

We scaffolded the [HTML](./src/index.html) with content, and need you to add fonts, images, styles and, for bonus points, interactivity!

You may set up tools and use whatever 3rd party code you feel is necessary, but it's not required.

Please ask questions, and help us help you if anything is unclear.

## Requirements

Please reference the [requirements](./REQUIREMENTS.md) document and contact [Ray Patterson](mailto:ray.patterson@wearekettle.com) with any questions.
